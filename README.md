# twitch-chat-extension

This project is a Google Chrome extension to embedd a Twitch chat into the official F1TV viewer or ESPN+ viewer.

It will automatically connect to the chatroom to either the LiveChatUFC or LiveChatF1 channels I have created on Twitch.

There will be a pop-up configuration option to toggle the Chat on or off, or use the embedded button that now exists in each of the player's controls.
